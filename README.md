This is just me posting random WPF things I decide to make when I get bored. To run it, you can just clone it and open the .slnx file in visual studio with the NET Desktop Development workload installed. 

For now, it just has a super simple snake game I randomly made in like 3-4 hours. It uses the WASD keys to move around. Code is in teh firstgame folder. Idk why I named it that

Theres also a random testing file with random stuff I was playing with, but it has nothing of value.
